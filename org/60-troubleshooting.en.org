#+TITLE: Troubleshooting (English)

**** Permission denied: .math-cache/*.tex
Cause:
- the container user cannot write into the bind mount

Recommended fix (Podman):

- mount the volume with =:U=:
  =./.math-cache:/app/.math-cache:rw,Z,U=

Why not =chmod 777=?  
- it works
- but it’s messy and potentially unsafe

**** curl: "Empty reply" / "unexpected eof"
Typical causes:

- you call the service via HTTPS, but the container serves HTTP
- or the other way around

Checklist:

#+begin_src bash
podman logs org-viewer
ss -tlpn | grep 5000
curl http://localhost:5000
#+end_src

**** TLS disabled (no cert/key found)
Possible reasons:

- CERT_FILE / KEY_FILE incorrectly set
- certificate volume not mounted to =/certs=
- wrong filenames or ownership inside the container

Debug:

#+begin_src bash
ls -al /certs
#+end_src
