#+TITLE: org-parser – Overview (English)

See also the [[file:10-overview.de.org][German version]].

** What is this?
=org-parser= is a small streaming Org reader and minimal Org→HTML exporter.

I built it so I can read my Org files on devices where I can’t install Emacs.

Building blocks:
- =org_reader.py=: reads Org files line-by-line and expands =#+INCLUDE= depth-first
- =org_parser.py=: streaming parser emitting events (=OrgEvent=)
- =org_to_html.py=: minimal renderer
- =webapp.py=: web viewer (Flask)
- =math_renderer.py=: LaTeX → SVG (cache)

Design goals:
- streaming / lazy
- “good enough” Org support
- clear state + events pipeline
